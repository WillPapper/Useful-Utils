Useful Utils
============

Short scripts that are useful to everyone.

About
-----
We all have scripts that we keep around, usually to automate common functions. Some people keep them private, never sharing useful code with others. Other people put them up on Pastebin, Github Gists, or a specialized git repo, but no one will ever find them there. When sharing useful scripts, discovery is a large issue.

Useful Utils seeks to create a centralized location for short, useful scripts. Automated an aspect of data collection? Great! Created utilities to automatically convert between common file types? Add a pull request! We're sure that someone else will find it useful, and they may even improve your code.

Guidelines
----------
Guidelines for adding scripts are quite loose to make contributing as easy as possible. While scripts should be relatively small and self-contained (i.e. just a few files, not an entire program), they can be written in any language and can serve any purpose.

**To add a utility, simply follow these four steps:**

1. Fork this repository

2. Copy the ["useful-utils-template"](https://github.com/wpapper/Useful-Utils/tree/master/useful-utils-template) directory and rename it to your utility's name. If you're confused, take a look at [useful-utils-example](https://github.com/wpapper/Useful-Utils/tree/master/useful-utils-example).

3. Fill out the README and add your code

4. Submit a pull request
